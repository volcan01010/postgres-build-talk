		The aim of this talk is to describe the architecture of BGS Sensor Data Service, the tools that we used to create it and some (hopefully helpful) hints that we learned in the process.

		As the main title suggests, this talk contains some code examples.
		Don't worry if you don't understand them; I'll explain what each does and the most important thing is to get a sense of how these systems are configured.

		<h4>BGS IT Infrastructure</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>Self-hosted virtual machines running on premises</li>
		<li>Long-standing corporate Oracle database</li>
		<li>Increasing use of PostgreSQL for microservices and collaborative projects</li>
		</ul>
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		Self-hosting our VMs means that we do not pay per minute; it is not expensive to run multiple servers with low loads.
		Microservices often include their own PostgreSQL databases as part of the software stack.
		If we use PostgreSQL, we can share workflows with partners in academia or countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Uganda.

		<li>Cluster settings are applied (e.g. pg_hba.conf) with setup scripts</li>
		<li>Configuration stored in /var/lib/postgres/data</li>
		</ul>
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		Docker is an easy way to install PostgreSQL.
		You can define scripts that are run when the container starts for the first time.
		These can be used to configure things such as the `pg_hba.conf`, which controls who can connect.
		All those settings are stored in `/var/lib/postgres/data`.
		Mounting `/var/lib/postgres/data` as a volume provides persistent data between changes to the container.

		We use Ansible to deploy the application and database to the server.
		Ansible is a server-configuration tool that can SSH onto a target machine and run scripts there.
		The scripts are declarative, so they define the end state rather than the steps to get there.
		They are also idempotent, which means they can be run repeatedly and always give the same result.

		The scripts copy across the `docker-compose.yml` file and create a `.env` file containing the environment variables.
		They then call `docker-compose up` to start the service.

		We have an extra step to reset the database, which can be triggered via an environment variable.
		This will drop the data volume and give us a fresh database when the service restarts.

		The sensor data are stored in the corporate Oracle database, where they are highly normalised and integrated with other internal data structures.
		We wrote a custom Python tool called `etlhelper` to transfer the data to the FROST servers.
		`etlhelper` solves two problems:

		+ It installs and configures the Oracle Instant Client on Linux, which can be a bit fiddly
		+ It provides a simple way to run a SQL query against a database and get the results back using Python

		`etlhelper` runs a query against Oracle and then posts the results to the FROST server via the API.
		Using the API allows FROST to take care of all the internal foreign table relationships.
		The asynchronous `aiohttp` Python library made inserting data much quicker.

	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		`etlhelper` is aimed at anyone who just wants to run a SQL query against a database and insert the results into another one.

		In the example above, `etlhelper` copies the data from the "src" table on "conn1" to the "exported" table on "conn2".
		Behind the scenes it handles things like cursors and transactions and transferring the data in chunks so that it doesn't take up too much space in memory.

		We open-sourced `etlhelper` two years ago, so you can look it up on GitHub and install it using `pip`.
		Please "star" the repo if it is useful to you.

		The DBAs don't have SSH to the servers to access the Docker containers and check their log files.
		This can make debugging tricky.

		Luckily PostgreSQL can make the logs available as a table that can be inspected via PgAdmin or other tools.
		This is done by configuring the database to write logs to a CSV file.
		The file is then mounted as a table using the `file_fdw` foreign data wrapper.

		Flyway is used to apply SQL scripts to configure databases
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		Flyway is an open source tool providing "version control for databases".
		It can run a series of SQL scripts against a remote server sequentially.
		We run it in our configuration pipeine from GitLab CI.

		The clever part about Flyway is that it records metadata about which have been run so they can be skipped the next time.
		It also stores a checksum for each file so it can see if the contents have changed.

		The files above contain the SQL scripts for creating the job loggins tables and more.
		Those in the `common` directory are run against all servers.
		There are also folders with specific configuration for individual servers.
		These are used to set up `pglogical` replication, as we will see later.

		The next step is to add a Public environment and redundancy for each server.

	</section>
	<section data-transition="fade-in" data-background-size="contain" data-background="images/006_add_replication.png">
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		There are three big changes to notice here.

		Firstly, we have added a Public environment.
		Not all the data are for public consumption.
		Some belong to other projects and others need to undergo checking before release.
		The Public environment allows us to publish a subset of the data.

		Secondly, there are now pairs of servers in each environment.
		The external network access to the servers balances the load between them, giving us redundancy.
		We are not Google and do not expect millions of hits, however it is important to keep the sensor data service running when a server needs to reboot to apply a kernel update.

		Thirdly, the new sensors are being populated via `pglogical` from the internal server and not via `etlhelper`.
		Populating the database via the API can be slow and, because the API calls happen asynchronously, they can result in data objects arriving in different orders and receiving differet internal ids.
		(We also store the Oracle ID on each object, so we could track it back, but it is still better if they match).

		`pglogical` is an open source Logical Replication extension for PostgreSQL.
		It provides an easy to way synchronise data tables and thus populate the data without using the API.
		It is easy to configure and data transfer is almost instantaneous.
		As a bonus using the API on the subscriber services means it can be made read-only, which increases security.

		A row filter on the `frost_public` replication set ensures that we only publish the public data.

		We now have 6 PostgreSQLs.

	pglogical replication is configured via SQL commands
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		The commands above demonstrate SQL commands for configuring `pglogical`
		Each server has to be created as a "node".

		We have also added a second PostgreSQL database in each server.
		This allows us to use Dev2 and Dev3 to test the replication scripts.

		In this case we didn't need to add a whole extra server, we just add a new database to the existing PostgreSQL clusters.
		The new databases are created by copying the main database as soon as the tables have been created by FROST.
		At this point they are empty and available for futher configuration with Flyway.

		We now have 10 PostgreSQLs.  I think that's enough.

	An idempotent script to clone a running database
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		This is the script used to clone the database during the pipeline.

		It is important that the script is idempotent as it will be run each the time CI pipeline runs, yet it only needs to create the database once.
		The first part of the script exits without error if the database already exists.

		The second part of the script uses `pg_dump` to backup the main database, the `psql` to apply the configuration.

	Storing script in container keeps CI logic clean
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		One final tip: we found it was cleaner to write the script and to bake it into the database container than to try to execute the commands directly from the CI pipeline code.

		This code snippet shows the Ansible task that runs the script against the servers in the `dev` group.

			<li>Is it common to use pglogical as part of ETL process?</li>
			<li>What are the pros/cons of using a database pool?</li>
			<li>What if we had to pay by the minute for servers?</li>
		</ul>
	<aside data-markdown class="notes">
		+ I don't think that 10 is too many.  When they are defined in code they are easy and quick to create and having all the different environments gives us a lot of flexibility in testing.
		+ I was really impressed by how fast and simple `pglogical` was.  I could imagine a situation where you could write the results of a complex join into a table and have it replicated out somewhere else to be used.
		+ This setup is simple e.g. one database and one API, paired on each server.  You could also use `pgbouncer` to pool the two databases, then have as many API servers as you want pointed at that.  Unless traffic is very high, I'm not sure that it would justify the extra complexity.
		+ It is cheap for us to have servers that run all the time but under minimal load.  If you have to reduce the server count, you could run multiple PostgreSQL clusters on a server on different ports, but you still need enough for redundancy after reboots.  Are there any other ways to consolidate them?
